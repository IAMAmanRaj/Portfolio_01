        started working on team projects and hackathons early in college — one of the best decisions I made. It opened my vision to the limitless scope of ideas and creativity. Made a team, and took part in <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-bold text-xl">Webster</span>, an annual hackathon with <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-extrabold text-xl">100+ </span> teams from 1st and 2nd year. Failed badly. Couldn't even qualify for the final evaluation round. Realised, that I needed to improve a l...o...t.

        October'24, I got the opportunity of leading the Web Team for Culrav-Avishkar, MNNIT's annual Techno-Cultural Fest.

Despite all the challenges you can think of, we successfully launched the website on time, achieving <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-bold text-xl">5.3K+</span> Google search appearances within the first week.
