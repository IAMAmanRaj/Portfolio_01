        started working on team projects and hackathons early in college — one of the best decisions I made. It opened my vision to the limitless scope of ideas and creativity. Made a team, and took part in <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-bold text-xl">Webster</span>, an annual hackathon with <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-extrabold text-xl">100+ </span> teams from 1st and 2nd year. Failed badly. Couldn't even qualify for the final evaluation round. Realised, that I needed to improve a l...o...t.

Worked on FE and BE of the MVP, that was involving a complex database schema. Got introduced to NestJS, Next.js, and tools like Prisma, Supabase to deal with SQL dbs. Here was the point when I started improving as a software developer. By making mistakes in production, and learning from them after panicking.

        <a href="https://skdiv.com" className="text-gray-400 "> www.skdiv.com </a>.

        <a href="https://truecutbarberstudio.com.au" className="text-gray-400 hover:cursor-pointerx"> truecutbarberstudio.com.au </a>. Got introduced to the laws of UI/UX, metrics affecting page loading time, core web vitals and SEO. Before this, I used to think that UI mostly has to be visually appealing, but I was mistaken. Complete mindset shift.

        October'24, I got the opportunity of leading the Web Team for Culrav-Avishkar, MNNIT's annual Techno-Cultural Fest. Guiding the juniors and collaborating with them taught me valuable lessons in leadership, teamwork, along with project delivery and management. Despite all the challenges you can think of, we successfully launched the website on time, achieving <span className="hover:cursor-pointer text-gray-400 font-bold text-xl">5.3K+</span> Google search appearances within the first week. Best time.

Lately been trying to become better at React.js and Javascript. Started working on some of my personal ideas. By this year end, my only goal is to become a better Frontend Engineer. Graduated in August with an offer in hand. Felt good but i'm surely not there yet. Exploring the vastness of Frontend Engineering and trying to excel at what I do best. Period.
